# Feliz.ReactFlatpickr Demo
## Requirements

* [dotnet SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/core) v8.0 or higher
* [node.js](https://nodejs.org) v18+ LTS


## Development

Before doing anything, start with installing npm dependencies using `npm install`.

Then to start development mode with hot module reloading, run:
```bash
npm start
```
This will start the development server after compiling the project, once it is finished, navigate to the host indicated by vite to view the application .

To build the application and make ready for production:
```
npm run build
```
This command builds the application and puts the generated files into the `deploy` directory (can be overwritten in webpack.config.js).
